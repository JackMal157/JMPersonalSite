         <h3>Hello, my name is Jack Malatesta. I’m a student currently attending Michigan State University. I plan on graduating in May of 2025 and created this site to showcase my career experience, interests, skills, and projects I have worked on while at school.  </h3>

         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I was born in Rochester Michigan. But moved to New Hampshire in 2011 where I grew up. My family consists of me, my parents, my sister and my dogs (pictured below). I have loved MSU ever since I was a kid and that played a big part in me coming here. </p>

     <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>I am a huge sports fan. I’d say it’s my favorite thing to talk about and watch. I don’t just like one or two sports I like to watch almost every sport. I’d say my top five favorite sports leagues are the NBA, NFL, MLB, NCAA Football, and NCAA Basketball. Below I’ve included links to each of the leagues pages incase readers want to learn more about the sports. </p>
